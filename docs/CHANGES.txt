I'm doing something a little weird here, which is normal for me.  IF I were
doing sometihng normal, it would be kind weird.

What I'm looking to do is to integrate some of the Linux tools into a big
directory ... which is how it once was.  I'm hoping to increate consistency
between them, and imporive integration, among other things.

Think of it as an experiment.
